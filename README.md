# Machine Learning / AI / Deep Learning Self Study

This repository documents my structured self study in:

- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning
- Mathematical Foundations

The goal is to understand concepts from first principles and implement them from scratch before using high level libraries.
